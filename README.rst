New
===

 * Multiple gateway routers. option-data routers can now be a list of gateways.

 * On Arch you can build using the provided PKGBUILD in the packaging directory or from the AUR.
   All git tags are signed with arch@sapience.com key which is available via WKD
   or download from https://www.sapience.com/tech. Add the key to your package builder gpg keyring.
   The key is included in the Arch package and the source= line with *?signed* at the end can be used
   to verify the git tag.  You can also manually verify the signature

 * Add output option "calculate-tee-times" : true (replaces explicit renew-timer, rebind-timer)

 * Add output option: "offer-lifetime": 60

 * Add global input options: "min-valid-lifetime", "valid-lifetime", "max-valid-lifetime"

   These can be overriden at the subnet level

 * If some lifetimes are set, missing ones are imputed using:

   min-valid-lifetime = valid-lifetime / 2

   max-valid-lifetime = valid-lifetime * 2

 * reservations : use FQDN for hostname. Hostname must be requested by client for kea to send it.


Breaking Change
---------------

kea has deprecated the option *reservation-mode* for versions of kea newer than 2.4.
These new versions will error if this option is used.

We have now removed this option from *kea-config* generated output. 

Please re-run *kea-config* to generate fresh configs. These new configs are compatible 
with version of kea newer than 2.4 as well as version 2.4.

Existing file */etc/kea/kea-dhcp4.conf* can also be edited to remove the line with the
deprecated option.

Overview
========

**What is kea?**

kea is a modern dhcp server from ISC (<https://www.isc.org/kea>) which supercedes its older
dhcp software. 

kea offers a nice feature set including the ability to have a hot standby server to pick up 
in case the primary is unavailable.
Its power also lurks behind a complicated configuration suite that, at least for me, is not 
terribly human friendly. 

Most notably each server requires it's own separate config and keeping them all 
synchronized can be a bit of a chore and which naturally is prone to human error.

**What is kea-config?**

kea-config provides a tool which takes a single configuration file as its input and 
it then generates the native kea configuration files needed from that single source of truth. 
By using a single configuration we can be assured that
the configs for the primary, standby and backup servers are consistent with one other.

It also provides the convenience of doing the DNS lookups for any host reservations, meaning 
the reservation is specified using hostname only not IP as expected by kea.

At the moment kea-config supports kea-dhcp4 and its companion control agent.

Installation  
============

Available on
 * `Github`_
 * `Archlinux AUR`_

On Arch you can build using the PKGBUILD provided in packaging directory or from the AUR package.

 .. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Manual Install

        rm -f dist/*
        /usr/bin/python -m build --wheel --no-isolation
        root_dest="/"
        ./scripts/do-install $root_dest

When running as non-root then set root\_dest a user writable directory
This will install the executable */usr/bin/kea-config* along with a
sample config in */usr/share/kea_config*

kea_config application
======================

kea-config is written in python and that is its sole dependency, hence python must be installed.

You can install it or run it out of the cloned repo (src/kea_config/kea-config.py)

Using kea-config 
----------------

Once installed, to use it, copy the sample config file in the *configs* dir, modify 
for your own setup and simply run it::

    kea-config -c <your.conf>

This will generate pairs of files, one kea config and one control agent config for each
of primary, standby and backup - or whatever subset you used in the conf file. 
    
e.g. it will create kea configs in the <conf_dir> which is defined config being used::

        kea-ctrl-agent-primary.conf
        kea-dhcp4-primary.conf

and similarly for standby and/or backup if requested. Each pair of files is to be used
on the corresponding server. e.g The 2 primary files are used on the kea-dhcp4 primary server.

One simple way to manage these is to copy the entire <conf_dir> to each kea server /etc/kea
then use sym links for kea config - linking to appropriate primary, standby or backup.

e.g. /etc/kea on primary would have ::

        kea-dhcp4.conf -> <conf_dir>/kea-dhcp4-primary.conf
        kea-ctrl-agent.conf -> <conf_dir>/kea-ctrl-agent-primary.conf


Summary of config variable
--------------------------

Comments begin with '#' and are ignored.
The conf file in standard TOML format and as usual sections are 
denoted by square brackets.
e.g.::

        some_variable = 'xxx'
        [section_1]
            a_variable = 'hi'
            a_list = ['1', 'two', 'three']

See the sample config for additional details. We summarize the main pieces here:

 * *title*

   For human use only - not used by kea-config.

 * *conf_dir*

   Directory where generated kea configs reside. What I do is rsync this directory to
   /etc/kea/ on each kea server. Each server then has a soft link to its own specific config.
   For example on my primary server I have

.. code:: bash

     ln -s <conf_dir>/kea-ctrl-agent-primary.conf kea-ctrl-agent.conf
     ln -s <conf_dir>//kea-dhcp4-primary.conf kea-dhcp4.conf

And similarly for standby and backup. 

 * *server_types*

   The list of servers used - should contain at least 'primary'. 
   e.g. server_types = ['primary',  'standby', 'backup']

 * [*global_options*]

   This section has some common dhcp information shared with dhcp clients:

        * domain-name-servers - list of DNS server IPs 
        * domain-name - what is sounds like
        * domain-search - list of (sub)domains to search (if any)
        * ntp-servers - list of local ntp server IPs (if any)

 * *[server.primary]* 

    Provides the information needed for the primary server
    interface, hostname, port, auth_user and auth_password

 * *[server.standby]* *[server.backup]*

   Same format as primary server section. Optional and only used if turned on in *server_types* list.

 * *[net]*

   This section describes the standard dhcp information including host IP reservations. 

    * dns_net

      internal domain, used to lookup IP for host reservations.

    * pools 

      list of IP ranges to use

    * subnet 
      
      what it sounds like

    * max-valid-lifetime 

      as usual in seconds 

    * *[net.option-data]*

      sub section with:

      - *broadcast-address*

      - *routers*
        
        default gateway(s) / route(s)
        May be list of ips ["ip1", "ip2",...] or single ip "ip1".

      - *ntp-servers*

        A list

        * *[net.reserved.XXX]*

          host XXX 
          hardware-address = "mac address" 

          Will reserve the IP for XXX based on dns lookup of XXX.
          Have as many of these as needed.


Discussion and Next Steps
=========================

This version is for kea-dhcp4 (IPv4).

Not all kea options are supported by kea-config. For example the high availibilty component of kea
allows for either hot-standby or load balancing. At moment we only support hot standby. 
Hot standby has one server at a time actively serving clients, whereas in load balancing case
both servers are servicing clients at same time.

To create a version for kea-dhcp6, for example where a firewall is responsible for passing 
prefix delegation to the internal hosts, one needs an IPV6 internet connection; I am unable 
to work on this at the moment.

While kea-config is distro agnostic, I do provide an Archlinux package available on the AUR.
